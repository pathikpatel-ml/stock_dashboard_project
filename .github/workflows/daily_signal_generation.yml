    # The python script generate_daily_signals.py now handles the git push.
    # If it didn't, you'd add a step like this:
    # - name: Push changes
    #   run: git push origin HEAD:${{ github.ref_name }} # Pushes to the current branch
    #   # Ensure you have authentication setup if the script doesn't handle it.
